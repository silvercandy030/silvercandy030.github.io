## About

My name is *Tang Xiuwen*. I am a senior studying in South China Normal University, majoring in software engineering. Given that I was granted an exemption for graduate entrance examination (ranking 4/115) and passed the second interview, I will be admitted by your school in 2020. In the past three years, I have participated in four student research projects including national and university level, two of which were hosted by me. Our team obtained some achievements like a software copyright and I published a paper in a Chinese core journal as the first author. In addition, I have participated in some competitions, such as mathematical modeling, data mining, computer design, programming languages, etc. and won some awards.
